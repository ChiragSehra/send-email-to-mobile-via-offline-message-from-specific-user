# send-email-to-mobile-via-offline-message-from-specific-user
This code might help you in getting over your daily life. This code wont help you that much but what is does is that it looks for some specific user in your email which you need to mention and then it will send you the subject and body of that email to your phone number by using a public SMS API. Before opening your client email, you know what it will be so that you can take a leave before starting the work and go on a vacation.


TODO:
1) Add this code to run every hour.
2) Save the attachment at the hosting server and provide link in the message.
3) Host this code somewhere freely
4) Encrypt creds.py before uploading to free server.
5) Make this work for company emails. ( Not working on my company email)
6) Remove SMS API and integrate with Whatsapp API.
7) Package it and let people use it freely.
